Rebuilding the GG Bridge with Legos.
(Not sure what the Avengers have to do with it...)

1. I would go to http://goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBDesign.php (or City Hall) and find stats about the dimensions of the GG Bridge. 
	1a. I would need the Height, Width, and Depth of all of the various parts of the GG Bridge. 
	1b. Piers, The Deck, the Towers, Main Suspsension, and the susppension cables
	1c. Math all of that!

2. Once I had the dimensions of all of those, I would have to find the volume of each respective part. 
	2a. Pier volume = PierHeight x PierWidth x PierDepth x TotalNumofPiers
		(repeat that process for each part of the bridge itself)
	2b. I would then have to get all of the volumes converted to a dimension that makes sense for legos, so milimeters most likely
	2c. Lets say my total volume of the GG bridge === X mms^3

3. Assuming I am going to use the medium basic lego, the volume of which = 4823.4 mm^3, I would then need to simply divide X mms^3 / 4823.4 mms^3 to get the total # of legos required to rebuild all of the parts of the GG bridge.
