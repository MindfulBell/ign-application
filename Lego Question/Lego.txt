Rebuilding the GG Bridge with Legos.
(Not sure what the Avengers have to do with it...)

Method A:

1. I would go to http://goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBDesign.php (or City Hall) and find stats about the dimensions of the GG Bridge. 
	1a. I would need the Height, Width, and Depth of all of the various parts of the GG Bridge. 
	1b. Piers, The Deck, the Towers, Main Suspsension, various supporting beams, and the susppension cables (it would be a challenge to find the suspension cable lengths as they vary as the main suspension reaches the bridge)

2. Once I had the dimensions of all of those, I would have to find the volume of each respective part. 
	2a. Pier volume = PierHeight x PierWidth x PierDepth x TotalNumofPiers
		(repeat that process for each part of the bridge itself)
	2b. I would then have to get all of the volumes converted to a dimension that makes sense for legos, so meters most likely
	2c. Lets say my total volume of the GG bridge === X ms^3

3. Assuming I am going to use the medium basic lego, the volume of which = 4823.4 mm^3 (or .0000048234 ms^3), I would then need to simply divide X ms^3 / .0000048234 mms^3 to get the total # of legos required to rebuild all of the parts of the GG bridge.



length of bridge: 8981 feet
width of bridge: 89 feet

towers x 2
	tower height: 746 feet
		each leg base: 33x54 feet (4 total, 2 for each leg)

cables x2: 
	diameter: 36 3/8 inches
	length: 7650 feet 

suspender ropes (500 of them):
	2-11/16 inches diameter

Problem is, I cannot find the depth of many of the parts of the GG bridge, only the height and width...



Method B:

On further inspection of the GG statistics site, I did find the total # of cubic meters of concrete and the total weight of steel used.
I converted the weight of steel used to its volume with the help of the internet to get the following

concrete used: 297,475 cubic meters of concrete
structure steel KGs used: 75,293,000 === 9653 cubic meters of steel

Total volume of material used: 307,128 ms^3 of material

Total # of legos = 307,128 ms^3 / .0000048234 ms^3 (volume of a medium lego in meters cubed)

Total # of legos = 63,674,586,391




Did I get it right?
